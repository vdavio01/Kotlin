## The `examples` repository for the SDP/SPIII modules 2018

There are three folders here:

+ `courseworks` - has individual folders for each of the IntelliJ projects.
+ `examples` - as the name suggests. The examples from each week of the course.
+ `worksheets` - the exercises to attempt throughout the course. Each worksheet is a separate IntelliJ project.
