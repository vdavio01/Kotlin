# Worksheet four (basic Math Functions)

1. Write a function called add that takes two Int parameters and returns their sum.

2. Write a function that returns the inclusive Range from start to end.

3. Write a function that returns a Range of odd n odd integers starting at 1.

4. Write a function that returns the minimum integer in the Array r.

   Your implementation must conform to the following rules:
   - You must use a while loop.
   - You may use both immutable (val) and mutable (var) variables.
   - You must use an if expression.
   
5. Write a function that returns the minimum integer in the Array r.
 
   Your implementation must conform to the following rules:
   - You must use a for loop (not for comprehension).
   - You may use both immutable (val) and mutable (var) variables.
   - You may not use an if expression.
   
6. Write a function called orig.minRecursive that returns the minimum integer in the Array r.

   Your implementation must conform to the following rules:
   - You may not use any loops.
   - You may not use any mutable (var) or immutable (val) variables.
   
7. Write a function that returns the base 36 equivalent of the BigInteger b.

8. Write a function that Splits a String in half.

   This function returns a tuple (f, e), where the f is the first
   half of the string and e is the last half of the string.
   
   Your implementation must conform to the following rules:
   - You may not use any loops.
   - You may not use recursion.
   - You may not use any mutable (var) or immutable (val) variables.
 
 9. Write a function that determines is a String is palindrome.
 
 Your implementation must conform to the following rules:
   - You may not use any loops.
   - You may not use any mutable (var) variables.
   
10. Write a function that counts the number of space delimited words in the provided array of Strings.
