# Worksheet Five

1. Write a function tail that takes a list and removes the first element, returning the rest
   of the list.
   
2. Write a function that replaces the first value in a list with a given value. If the
   list is empty, it adds the value to the front of the list.
   
3. Write a function that removes n elements from the given list. If n is greater than the
   length of the list, the function returns an empty list.
   
4. Write a function that takes a list and removes the last element.
   Implement this function recursively, preferably using pattern matching.
   
5. Write a function that reduces a list down to a single value by iteratively applying a
   function over the elements of the list and carrying the cumulative result along.
   
6. Use your implementation of foldLeft to implement these functions:
   - sum: produces the sum of all elements.
   - product: produces the product of all elements.
   - length: finds the length of the list.
   
7. Write a function that reverses the elements of a list.

8. Write a function that takes a list of lists and produces a list by joining all the sublists into one list.

9. Write a function that returns a list containing the resutls of applying the given function to the original list (map).

10. Write a function that removes all elements from a list for which a given predicate returns false.

11. Write a function that returns a single list of all elements yielded from results of transform function 
(the transform function returns a list) being invoked on each element of original array (flatMap).

12. Write a function that takes maxAverage takes a list of triples numbers) and returns the average value 
of the largest value in each triple.

13. Write a function that calculates the variance of the elements of a list.
